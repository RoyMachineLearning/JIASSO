Helping CLC to bridge the gaps and improve learning experience

Problem Statement:

"How do we manage a room of learners with different experience levels and learning speeds? CLC would like to provide support for mentors and instructors to identify learners that are struggling with pace and are not comfortable publicly voicing it. Please also consider ease of use for children or those that are newer to technology."


Problem Scope 1: Managing learners with different experience level

Proposed Solution: Predicitng adults/children that expressed intentions to pursue coding at post secondary level or work in the technical sector versus those who want to work or study coding/technology

Problem Scope 2: Learners who struggle with the pace or are not comfortable publicly voicing it

Proposed Solution: Predicting adults/children who want to take additional coding/technical learning or coding task at work or use coding 

Problem Scope 3: Promoting ease of use among childrens, adults and teachers
