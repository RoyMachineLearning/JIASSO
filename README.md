Helping CLC to bridge the gaps and improve learning experience

<b>Problem Statement:</b>

"How do we manage a room of learners with different experience levels and learning speeds? CLC would like to provide support for mentors and instructors to identify learners that are struggling with pace and are not comfortable publicly voicing it. Please also consider ease of use for children or those that are newer to technology."


<b>Problem Scope 1:</b> Managing learners with different experience level
<br>
Proposed Solution: Predicitng adults/children that expressed intentions to pursue coding at post secondary level or work in the technical sector versus those who want to work or study coding/technology

<b>Problem Scope 2:</b> Learners who struggle with the pace or are not comfortable publicly voicing it
<br>
Proposed Solution: Predicting adults/children who want to take additional coding/technical learning or coding task at work or use coding 

<b>Problem Scope 3:</b> Promoting ease of use among childrens, adults and teachers
<br>
Proposed Solution: Predicting adults/children/teachers who are likely to recommend CLC to freind, colleage, parent, etc
                   Predicting the teachers who are likely to make donations to CLC
